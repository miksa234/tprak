# Classical Teleportation

We are asked to discuss sending matter (A) or information (B) with respect to
the following questions

    * a) scenario (A), decomposing a human being or a piece of matter before
      sending, where would you stop decomposing (organ level, cell level,
      molecule level, atom level or smaller)? Choose a level and think what
      technical limits a decomposition and rebuilding would require roughly

      Answer:
        All in all the smaller we go the harder it is to
        decompose, but the faster it is to send. To understand what I mean
        consider we decompose on the organ level, then we have massive parts
        that need to be sent from point A to point B via normal transportation,
        i.e. bus, car or even a spaceship. The transportation method itself
        would make the term 'teleportation' meaningless. On the other hand say
        we decompose on the molecule level however impossible it may be. Now the human
        body is made of roughly 80% H20 imagine we have constructed a safe vacuum
        pipeline to send H20 particles from point A to B, with a roughly
        estimated velocity  of 0.01% of the speed of light, this would make the atom
        level teleportation faster in terms of transportation than organ level
        teleportation. But the issues we would face of decomposing a human body into
        atoms and then putting it back together are immense, not to even
        mention if we can be absolutely be certain we can compose the same
        person again, without losing personality/memory.

    * b) consider (A) and assume you want to send atoms. How long would it take
      to transfer the atoms of a typical human being?

      Answer:
        There are approximately 7*10^27 atoms in a 70kg adult body, where 80% are
        hydrogen (54%) and oxygen (26%). The ionization energy of hydrogen is
        13.6 eV meaning the maximum speed hydrogen can travel before becoming purely an
        electron and a proton is roughly 0.01% the speed of light and for
        oxygen we have 0.0025% so in the mean lets
        say 0.0025% the speed of light (compensating the other 20% more massive
        than hydrogen that we didn't consider).
        That means to send an atom of the human body from earth to the sun
        (150*10^9 m) we would need about 74 days. Now for the mean atom radius
        of the atoms in the human body we take oxygen (60pm), forming a straight
        line of 7*10^27 atoms of 60pm radius we have 8.4*10^17 m. The conclusion
        is it would take too long to send them.

    * c) consider (B) say each lattice pos. (10^-10m) of the volume of the
      human being is filled with an atom (hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, kalium) or
      no atom. How many bits do you need to describe one lattice position, how
      much of the human being (2x1x1m)? Assume each bit is encoded by a light
      pulse of a frequency of 2*10^-15s? How long would it roughly take to send
      the full information of the position of the atoms of a human being?

      Answer:
        Since a bit can be either a "1" or a "0" and we need to encode 6
        possible outcomes that can be in one lattice, hydrogen, oxygen,
        calcium, kalium or no atom. This can be done with 3 bits. As for the
        human body we need to map a discrete 3-d space of resolution 10^-10
        from 2x1x1m and the 6 possible outcomes indicating which atom is or is
        not in a lattice. The resolution of 10^-10 for three numbers plus 6
        outcome posibilities can be encoded in
        log_2(10^10) \simeq [35](35) bits (round up!)
